# usePopcorn Project

Welcome to the usePopcorn project! This React-based application is designed to provide movie enthusiasts with a seamless experience to search for movies, rate them, and manage a personal watchlist.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Easily find your favorite movies with our responsive search feature.
- **User Ratings**: Rate movies and see how others have rated them with our integrated star rating system.
- **Watchlist Management**: Keep track of movies you've watched and those you want to see with a personalized watchlist.

## Hooks

To enhance functionality and maintain clean code, we've implemented custom hooks:

- `useKey`: Manages keyboard events for improved accessibility and control.
- `useLocalStorageState`: Preserves state between sessions using LocalStorage.
- `useMovies`: Fetches movie information from the API efficiently.

## About the Project

usePopcorn is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **JavaScript**: The scripting language providing interactivity.
- **CSS**: For styling and visually enhancing the application.
- **HTML**: The markup language used to structure content on the web.
